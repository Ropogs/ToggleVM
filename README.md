# ToggleVM
This script is an interactive tool for managing Hyper-V virtual machines and their Parsec connections. It lets you start, stop, restart, or force-kill VMs; launch, toggle, or auto-close Parsec; and create, overwrite, and apply checkpoints with live search functionality. It works best with https://github.com/jamesstringerparsec/Easy-GPU-PV
